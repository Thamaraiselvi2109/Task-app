<h3>Task Brief</h3>
Develop a responsive task management application using React that empowers users to efficiently create, organize, and track their tasks. The application should feature user authentication via Firebase, allowing users to sign in with Google. Users should be able to create, edit, and delete tasks, categorize them (e.g., work, personal), and set due dates. Additionally, implement drag-and-drop functionality for task organization, sorting options based on due dates, and a board/list view to enhance user experience.

The application should prioritize an intuitive user interface, ensuring that users can easily navigate through their tasks and access essential features. Utilize React Query or an alternate solution for effective data fetching and state management, and ensure the design is responsive, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes.
